          About the company on the other hand, we denounce with righteous
          indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the
          charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire. <br />
          <br />
          The digital and the cognitive revolutions are affecting how companies
          connect with users and employees. Companies are simultaneously looking
          to boost their consumer experiences and to transform themselves
          internally. Barlan is a pure play on the digital and cognitive space.
          We leverage the latest technologies and methodologies to help
          organizations transform in every aspect. We want to transform the
          world, one step at a time. <br />
          <br />
          We thrive by transforming organizations for a digital and cognitive
          future, and we dream to transform our industry with world-class
          opportunities for talent around the globe. <br />
